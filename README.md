This Rep contains the completed assignment probelm-1 of Hloov Data Science Qualification Round.

The EDA Preprocessing & data visualization.ipynb file contains the code ran for preprocessing RTU.csv file along with visualization insights of the RTU.csv file.

The Hloov Linear Regression (HVAC System Electricity).ipynb contains the code for the Linear Regression model, which was used to predict the HVAC System: Electricity feature of the RTU.csv dataset.

The Hloov RTU Electricty Forecasting.ipynb contains the code for a neural network which has been used to forecast the "RTU: Electricity" feature with respect to "Timestamp" feature to forecast the RTU: Electricity for the next 7 days.
